# Push Whitepaper

Push is a decentralized social platform where users meet people who have the same short term life mission.

## Introduction

Motivations are things that drive us to do things every day, whether you’re hungry or tired, or thirsty. Push is the idea that people in general have a motivation to engage with other people, to interact with other people. That’s been very important to stay motivated: people tend not to keep their motivation very well on their own.

Push can develop some new ways to quantify motivation and help people to stay motivated.
